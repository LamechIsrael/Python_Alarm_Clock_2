# Python_Alarm_Clock_2

This is the second Alarm Clock made for my class at Backer College.

The class is Computer Science 1100A - Python.

Unlike the first alarm clock, this one takes input.
Now, you can run the program and it will print for you the time the alarm is set for.
Just remember that this is set in 24-hour notation (military time).

Whereas the last project was go make me accustomed to the syntax of Python,
this project taught me how to get inputs from users.
